To use this package, add the following lines to your configuration file:

```yaml linenums="1"
packages:
  relay_regulator:
    url: https://github.com/XavierBerger/Solar-Router-for-ESPHome/
    file: solar_router/regulator_mecanical_relay.yaml
```

This package require the definition of pin connected to the gate of the relay : `regulator_gate_pin`

```yaml linenums="1"
substitutions:
  # Regulator configuration ------------------------------------------------------
  # Define GPIO pin connected to the relay gate.
  relay_regulator_gate_pin: GPIO22
```

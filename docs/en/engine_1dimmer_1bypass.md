# Engine 1 x dimmer + 1 x bypass

This package implements the engine of the solar router which determines when and how much energy has to be diverted to the load, with a bypass function for maximum efficiency.

When the regulator is intensively used for an extended period, the regulator will tends to overheat. This engine is designed to avoid this issue by activating a bypass relay and turning off the regulator when the regulator is opened at 100% for an extended period. To avoid flickering, the bypass relay is activated only when the regulator is opened at 100% for a number of consecutive regulation.

**Engine 1 x dimmer + 1 x bypass** calls every second the power meter to get the actual energy exchanged with the grid. If energy produced is greater than energy consumed and exceeds the defined exchange target, the engine will determine the **percentage of regulator opening** and adjusts it dynamically to reach the target. When the regulator reaches 100% for an extended period, the bypass relay is activated for maximum efficiency.

Engine's automatic regulation can be activated or deactivated with the activation switch.

## How to wire the bypass relay

- Live on the Bypass Relay Common (COM) and on the Relay to the Live Input of the Regulator
- Normally Closed (NC) floating
- Normally Open (NO) of the Relay to the Load Output of the Regulator (or directly to the Load)

!!! Danger "Follow the wiring instructions"
    Do not plug the Regulator Live Input to the Normally Closed (NC) of the relay ! Your load would be de-energized while switching the relay, potentially creating arcs inside the relay.

## Router Level vs Regulator Opening

The solar router uses three distinct but related level controls:

- **Router Level**: This is the main system-wide control (0-100%) that represents the overall routing state. It controls the LED indicators and energy counter logic. When automatic regulation is enabled, this level is dynamically adjusted based on power measurements.

- **Regulator Opening**: This represents the actual opening level (0-100%) of the physical regulator. By default, it mirrors the router level since there is only one regulator. While it can be controlled independently, changes to regulator_opening alone won't affect the router_level or trigger LED state changes.

- **Bypass Relay**: This represents the actual state (ON/OFF) of the physical bypass relay. When the Regulation is enabled, this relay automatically turns on after the duration `Bypass tempo` defined in Home Assistant. When the Regulation is disabled, you can manually trigger this relay to fully energized your load, LEDs and Energy Counter (if enabled) will not be triggered. You can also set the *Router Level* to 100, this will enable the relay, fully energized your load, trigger LEDs and Energy Counter.

## Configuration

To use this package, add the following lines to your configuration file:

```yaml linenums="1"
packages:
  solar_router:
    url: https://github.com/XavierBerger/Solar-Router-for-ESPHome/
    files:
      - path: solar_router/engine_1dimmer_1bypass.yaml
        vars:
          green_led_pin: GPIO1
          green_led_inverted: 'False'
          yellow_led_pin: GPIO2
          yellow_led_inverted: 'False'
          hide_regulators: 'True'
          hide_leds: 'True'
```

When this package is used it is required to define `green_led_pin` and `yellow_led_pin` in `vars` section as show in the upper example.

* `xxx_led_inverted` can define is led is active on high or low signal and is optional.
* `hide_regulators` allow to hide or show regulators sensors from HA and is optionnal.
* `hide_leds` allow to hide or show leds values from HA and is optionnal.

!!! tip "Adjusting Bypass Tempo"
    The `Bypass Tempo` determines how many consecutive regulations at 100% are needed before activating the bypass relay. A lower value will make the bypass more reactive but might cause more frequent switching (flickering). Because there's roughly 1 regulation per second, `Bypass Tempo` can be approximated as the time in second with the regulator at 100% before which the the bypass relay is activated.

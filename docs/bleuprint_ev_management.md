# Blueprint for EV management

This blueprint is designed to activate and deactivate the solar router when EV requiring charge is connected and enough energy is produced to charge this EV.

Here is a transcription of the prompt which help me to create this blueprint wiht AI.  
It clearly explain how it behaves:

```
I would like to write a blueprint for Home Assistant that implements the following algorithm: 

// EV is disconnected
IF NOT ev_connected 
THEN activate the solar router

// EV is connected and its battery needs to be charged
IF ev_connected
   AND energy_diversion > max_diverted_energy (%) 
   AND energy_sent_to_grid is greater than excess_energy_threshold 
       FOR delay_before_deactivation in seconds 
THEN deactivate the solar router

// EV battery is fully charged
IF ev_connected
   AND the solar router is deactivated 
   AND the energy sent back to the grid is greater than max_energy_sent 
       FOR delay_before_activation 
THEN activate the solar router.

The blueprint should be written in English and each variable should be commented.
```

To install this blueprint, refer to [Home assistant documention](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/using_blueprints/).

!!! note
    EV connected is a binary sensor. If your EV charge is displaying a string saying id EV is connected or not it will be required to create a custom sensors to create this binary sensor.

    Example for MyEnergi Zappi:

    ```yaml
    template:
        - binary_sensor:
            - name: "EV Connected Status"
              unique_id: ev_connected_status
              state: "{{ is_state('sensor.myenergi_zappi_plug_status', 'EV Connected') }}"
              device_class: plug

    ```
